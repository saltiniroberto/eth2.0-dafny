     *  This mainly consists in advancing the slot number to

     *  states (and block headers). 
     *  Under normal circumstances, where a block is received at each slot,
     *  this involves only one iteration of the loop.
     *  Otherwise, the first iteration of the loop `finalises` the block header
     *  of the previous slot before recortding it,

     *  and blocks for each slot.

     *  @param  slot    The slot to advance to. This is usually the slot of newly

     *  @returns        The state obtained after advancing the history to slot.

     *                  the while bdoy must be executed at least one time.
     *                  To simplify the proof, we have taken this first iteration
     *                  outside of the loop. It does not change the semantics
     *                  but enables us to use the state obtained after the first
     *                  iteration the loop and prove it is the same as
